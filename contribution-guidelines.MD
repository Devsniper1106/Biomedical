## Guidelines for contributing

Most of the information in the database is obtained directly from company materials. However there are a handful of data elements which require the judgement of the curator. Below we describe those fields and provide rough guidelines to help maintain consistency.

  * Good: _Quality control and assurance of pharmaceutical products_
  * Bad: _Using proprietary technology, the best science, and advanced AI techniques, the Eterly app acts like a personal coach--custom designing and adjusting, in real time--a health and fitness routine mapped to precisely fit each user’s specific needs. The project has been inspired, developed, and funded by longevity experts._

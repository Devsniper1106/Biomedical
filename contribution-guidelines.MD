## Guidelines for contributing

Most of the information in the database is obtained directly from company materials. However there are a handful of data elements which require the judgement of the curator. Below we describe those fields and provide rough guidelines to help maintain the consistency of the resource. 


* **Description** - Subjective one-sentence summary of the company (25 words or fewer). Avoid buzz-words and marketing phrases like “state-of-the-art”, “revolutionary”, etc.
  * Good: _Quality control and assurance of pharmaceutical products_
  * Bad: _Using proprietary technology, the best science, and advanced AI techniques, the Eterly app acts like a personal coach--custom designing and adjusting, in real time--a health and fitness routine mapped to precisely fit each user’s specific needs. The project has been inspired, developed, and funded by longevity experts._ 
* **Function** - choose 1 from [functional category table](#functions)      
* **Industry** - choose 1 from industry table below     
* **Code repository** - only included if the repository contains **non-trivial** code. Examples of trivial code: a token sale contract, forked repos without any commits, etc. 
* **Technical whitepaper** - only included if it provides details about token economics, the protocol, or implementation details (architecture, software stack, etc.).
